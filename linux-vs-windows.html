	<h2>Linux:</h2>
	<p>Linux could be a free and open supply OS supported operating system standards. It provides programming interface still as programme compatible with operating system primarily based systems and provides giant selection applications. A UNIX operating system system additionally contains several severally developed parts, leading to UNIX operating system that is totally compatible and free from proprietary code.</p>

	<h2>Windows:</h2>
	<p>Windows may be a commissioned OS within which ASCII text file is inaccessible. it’s designed for the people with the angle of getting no programming information and for business and alternative industrial users. it’s terribly straightforward and simple to use.</p>

	<p>The distinction between Linux and Windows package is that Linux is completely freed from price whereas windows is marketable package and is expensive. Associate operating system could be a program meant to regulate the pc or computer hardware Associate behave as an treater between user and hardware.</p>
	<p>Linux is a open supply package wherever users will access the ASCII text file and might improve the code victimisation the system. On the opposite hand, in windows, users can’t access ASCII text file, and it’s a authorized OS.</p>
	<p>Let’s see that the difference between Linux and windows:</p>
